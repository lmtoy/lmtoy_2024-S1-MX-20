this project observes a few galaxies in dual IF:  12CO and 13CO.   IN 12CO the signal was wider than the 
default dv=100, so we took 150, and for NGC5899 even wider.
In individual cases some baselines were unusually unstable and will need close inspection.


IC3392 - detection

NGC4189 - detection

NGC5347 - detection, but vlsr seems bit higher ~2400 (NED:  2380)

NGC5899 - detection, but signal was much wider, probably needs dv=350. 
          also vlsr=2650 or so, but needs checking with NED ? PI seems to give
          lower value
