this project observes a few galaxies in dual IF:  12CO and 13CO.   In 12CO the signal was wider than the 
default dv=100, so we took 150, and for NGC5012 and NGC5899 even wider.

In individual cases some baselines were unusually unstable and will need close inspection.


IC3392 - detection

NGC3338 - detection

NGC3430 - detection, unclear at 13CO

NGC3486 - detection

NGC4189 - detection

NGC4536 - detection (but dual bank issues?   there's SB0 and SB1 also; SB0 very clear detecting in 12CO)

NGC5012 - detection, signal very wide, we picked dv=300

NGC5347 - detection, but vlsr seems bit higher ~2400 (NED:  2380)

NGC5899 - detection, but signal was much wider, probably needs dv=350. 
          also vlsr=2650 or so, but needs checking with NED ? PI seems to give
          lower value 

NGC5033\_SB0 - detection, note that there's a SB0 and SB1 here. SB1 does not have a clear detection.
 
NGC5033 - detection. Seperate from SB0 and SB1.
